<b>This is an Androzic plugin.</b> It requires Androzic to be installed. It receives text messages (SMS) from GPS trackers and displays its locations on Androzic map. Requires Androzic version 1.7.3 or higher.

Currently supports Xexun TK-102, TK-103 trackers. May be it supports other Xexun trackes, but it is not tested.

Plugin can show notifications when a new text message from a tracker is received.

After installing plugin <b>you have to run Androzic once</b> to initialize it. Otherwise plugin will not monitor SMS messages until Androzic is started.
